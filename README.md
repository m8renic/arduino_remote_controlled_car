Basically, I've made this project for my graduation thesis. It's nothing groundbreaking nor is the code anything impressive.

The base of the vehicle is the Lego Technic 42154 set. Alongside that, there was the FireBeetle 2 ESP32-E microcontroller
which communicated with a Sony DualShock 4 controller over bluetooth. Hobbywing Quicrun 2435 SL Brushless Motor G3 and 
Hobbywing Quicrun 16BL30 ESC were in charge of making the whole thing move, the Tower SG90 was used to steer the wheels
(even though it was underpowered for the job just like the DC motor was). For the car sounds I used the Fermion DFPlayer
Pro MP3 module with two 8 Ohm 3W speakers. WS2812B RGB LED diodes were used for front and back lights and two Ovonic 7.4V
2200mAh 50C Li-Po batteries in parallel were powering the whole thing.

While the project itself worked, there are some changes that would have improved the quality. For starters, a different
servo and DC motor with more torque and less rotations per minute would have been excellent. Some smaller batteries
would help with more efficient usage of space. Lastly, the platform for the RC car could have been custom designed
instead of taking a Lego Technic set of the shelf and modifying it.
